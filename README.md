### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
This is a language translator application which recognizes the user's voice, translates it in desired language, prints the translated text on the screen and gives the audio output of the translated text. It also helps the user to understand the pronunciation of a particular language. This application will resolve the problem of communication gap between people due to lack of knowledge of languages. User can listen to the translation in same accent as of the region, which makes this application very useful. This project uses python API's such as speech recognition, googletrans, gtts. This project is made from django framework for backend and HTML,CSS, Javascript for the frontend.
